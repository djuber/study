I want to set a firm date for an RCHSA exam to put a deadline and
pressure on myself.I think no less than 2 months and no more than
6 are appropriate, since I also want to finish the RHCE in coming year.

I see [TrainUp](http://www.trainup.com/TrainingDetails/189285/Red-Hat-Certified-System-Administrator-RHCSA-Exam) has these exams about once per month.
I think 7-10-2015 is too soon, and I'll plan then for 9-18-2015.
They have a similar schedule for RHCE exams.
Conceivably 11-6-2015 or 12-4-2015 might be optimistic targets for this.
Unfortunately, these seem always to be on a Friday
(which is a small scheduling conflict for me, but not a deal breaker,
as it's a few blocks away from the office, and runs from 9-12.)
I could do this with only 5 hours off (8AM to 1PM),
and that's more than permissible. I'm not putting money on the table yet,
but I'm holding out that this is the right next step.
